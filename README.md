# MyMachineLearning

## Repo Intro

This repo is to construct a basic Machine Learning Algorithm library for learning and testing, each algorithm comes with a classic miniproject application.

## File Structure

Each directory include an algorithm with a mini project using this algorithm(data included), the projects as well as the algorithms are listed in a recommended reading sequence:

        -- kNeibohood.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""
        -- imageRecognizer.py
          """ mini project, MNIST image recognizer"""
        -- digits
