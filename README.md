# MyMachineLearning

## Repo Intro

This repo is to construct a basic Machine Learning Algorithm library for learning and testing, each algorithm comes with a classic miniproject application.

## File Structure

Each directory include an algorithm with a mini project using this algorithm(data included), the projects as well as the algorithms are listed in a recommended reading sequence:

    -- KNN
    
        -- kNeibohood.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""
        -- imageRecognizer.py
          """ mini project, MNIST image recognizer"""
        -- digits
          """ MNIST dataset"""
        -- basicFunction.py
          """ Helper function"""
          
    -- KTrees
    
        -- ktrees.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""
        -- lenseproject.py
          """ mini project, lense recognizer"""
        -- lenses.txt
          """ dataset for lense project"""
        -- plottree.py 
          """ helper method to help you plot your ktrees data structure."""
          
    -- Bayes
     
       -- bernoullibayers.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""
        -- spamproject.py
          """ mini project, spam recognizer"""
        -- email
          """ dataset for spam project"""
          
    -- Logistic Regression
     
       -- logisticRegression.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""
        -- horseproject.py
          """ mini project, spam recognizer"""
        -- horseClinicTest.txt & horseClinicTraining.txt
          """ dataset for spam project"""
          
    -- SVM
     
       -- svm.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""

    -- Adaboost
     
       -- adaboost.py
          """ core algorithm implementation"""      
    
## How to use

    1, download the repo to local, a star to the repo is appreciated
    
    2, make sure Python2 is installed, a virtual env is recommended
    
    3, pip install -r requirement.txt
    
    4, run core algorithm file or miniproject file directly.
 
## More to do

A lot of algorithm are coming soon, include:

[x] SVM

[x] Adaboost

[]  Regression and Tree Regression

[]  Kmeans

[]  EM

[]  PCA

[]  SVD
